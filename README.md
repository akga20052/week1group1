# week1group1
In this project, you will be tasked with creating a new website for a “Fake CRM”. This website’s mock design is also included in this file. This will be a group project in which each person should share an equal role in the finished product.

One person from the group (Original Team Member) will need to create the starter files in their Github Profile. From there each person will need to fork & clone the repository and begin working on their portion of the product. When each of you have completed your parts of the project, commit them back to github and submit a pull request to the original team member’s repository. Each person will then need to submit the original team member’s github link to google classroom.

Also, to help with workflow management, you may use github's "projects" tab to seperate and manage what has been done. You will need to create 3 boards which are "Work to be done", "In-Progress", and "Completed".

TASK: - Create Website using CSS3. ChallengeCreate a responsive design using Bootstrap or CSS Grid

** On the following monday, each group will be required to present a 5-10min presentation of the project. Including any learning experiences along the way and how those were handled **

IMPORTANT NOTES : EACH member of the team must commit work. Also, a README file will need to show each of your names and what file/code you completed. The project is not considered complete until it has been checked in (uploaded) to your GitHub account and the original team member's link posted to the Google Classroom assignment(each person individually). All photos can be placeholder images

HELPFUL HINT: The original repository holder should create all files and split the work based on the team's agreement. Splitting up the work inside of the CSS and HTML files is recommended!

** Please check the rubric for specific requirements**
